jcrop-specify
=============

This script requires both jQuery and jCrop.

The script allows a user to input values into width and height fields to create a cropping area for an image.

Just add the script to the head of your main document, then the form to the body of your document and the post.php relative to the action on the form.

When a user inputs values a cropping area is created then upon form submit the image is downloaded. No images are left on the server.
